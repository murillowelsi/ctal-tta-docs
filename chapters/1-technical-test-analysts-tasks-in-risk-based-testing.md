# Chapter 1: The Technical Test Analyst's Tasks in Risk-Based Testing (30 minutes)

- [x] 1.1 Introduction - _Date Completed:_ 08/01/2024 - _Understanding Level:_ 😊

    - Test Manager: Responsible for creating and overseeing risk-based testing strategy.
    - Test Manager collaborates with Technical Test Analysts.
    - Technical Test Analysts: Work within the established testing framework.
    - Technical Test Analysts identify technical product risks (e.g., security, reliability, performance).
    - They help address project risks related to test environments (e.g., acquisition, setup for testing).

- [x] 1.2 Risk-based Testing Tasks - _Date Completed:_ 08/01/2024 - _Understanding Level:_ 😊

    - Technical Test Analysts perform risk-based testing tasks.
    - Tasks include risk identification, assessment, and mitigation.
    - These tasks are iterative and adapt to emerging risks and changing priorities.
    - Regular evaluation and communication of risk status are crucial throughout the project.

    - [x] 1.2.1 Risk Identification - _Date Completed:_ 08/01/2024 - _Understanding Level:_ 😊

        - Broad stakeholder involvement is crucial for thorough risk identification.
        - Technical Test Analysts possess unique technical skills and are well-suited for the task.
        - They conduct expert interviews, brainstorm with colleagues, and analyze experiences to pinpoint potential product risks.
        - Technical Test Analysts collaborate closely with diverse stakeholders, including developers, architects, operations engineers, product owners, local support offices, technical experts, and service desk technicians.
        - Involving multiple stakeholders ensures a holistic view of risks and is typically coordinated by Test Managers.
        - Risks identified by Technical Test Analysts are often based on the ISO 25010 product quality characteristics outlined in Chapter 4 of the syllabus.

    - [x] 1.2.2 Risk Assessment - _Date Completed:_ 08/01/2024 - _Understanding Level:_ 😊

        - Risk identification vs. risk assessment: Identifying and categorizing risks.
        - Likelihood of product risk: Probability of system failure.
        - Roles in understanding risks: Technical Test Analyst (probability) and Test Analyst (business impact).
        - Project risk factors: Conflict, communication, tools, time, quality assurance, change rates.
        - Product risk factors: Technology complexity, code complexity, source code changes, defects, interface issues.
        - Risk assessment process: Technical Test Analyst proposes likelihood, Test Manager may modify, Test Analyst determines impact.

    - [x] 1.2.3 Risk Mitigation - _Date Completed:_ 08/01/2024 - _Understanding Level:_ 😊

        - Technical Test Analysts influence testing responses to identified risks
        - Key responsibilities include designing test cases, reducing risk through execution, and evaluating risks throughout the project
        - Collaboration with specialists in areas like security and performance for risk mitigation
        - ISTQB® Specialist syllabus like Security Testing and Performance Testing provide additional information
