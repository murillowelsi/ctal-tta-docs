## 5.1 Technical Test Analyst Tasks in Reviews

- Technical Test Analysts are essential in the technical review process, providing unique and operational viewpoints.
- All review participants, including analysts, require formal training to understand their roles effectively.
- Maintaining a constructive relationship with authors during the review process is important.
- Analysts contribute to technical reviews and inspections, often highlighting aspects developers might miss.
- They play a key role in creating, applying, and maintaining review checklists and providing defect severity information.
- Adequate preparation time for analysts is crucial for effective reviews, allowing them to thoroughly examine work products and related documentation.
- Reviews should encompass understanding the written content, identifying what is missing, verifying technical correctness, and ensuring consistency with other ongoing developments.
  - Without adequate preparation time, the review can become an editing exercise rather than a true review.
- When reviewing integration level test plans, analysts need to consider readiness for integration, dependencies, and the availability of testing data.

- For example, when reviewing an integration level test plan, the Technical Test Analyst must also consider the items that are being
  integrated.
  - Are they ready for integration?
  - Are there dependencies that must be documented?
  - Is there data available to test the integration points?
- Reviews should extend beyond the immediate work product, taking into account its interaction with other system components.
