- Checklists are utilized during reviews to ensure specific points are verified.
- Checklists help to make the review process less personal, indicating that the same standards apply to everyone's work.

### Types of Checklists

#### Generic Checklists

- Used for all reviews, focusing on verifying the proper usage of terms like ("shall", "should"), formatting, and similar conformance items.

#### Focused Checklists

- Target specific quality aspects or areas like security or performance efficiency.

#### Development of Checklists

- Best when developed by the organization itself, as they reflect:
  - The nature of the product.
  - The local development environment, including:
    - Staff
    - Tools
    - Priorities
  - History of previous successes and defects.
  - Specific issues such as performance efficiency or security.

#### Customization of Checklists

- They should be tailored to fit the organization and potentially the specific project.
- The chapter provides examples of such checklists.

### 5.2.1 Architectural Reviews

- Software architecture consists of the fundamental concepts or properties of a system, embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution [ISO 42010].

- Checklists used for the architectural review aspects of websites, especially focusing on their time behavior. For example, verification of the proper implementation of the following items:

```markdown
• Architectural Checklist

✓ Connection Pooling: Reduces execution time by establishing a shared pool of database connections.
✓ Load Balancing: Ensures even distribution of load across multiple resources.
✓ Distributed Processing: Involves processing across multiple computational elements.
✓ Caching: Utilizes local copies of data to decrease access time.
✓ Lazy Instantiation: Delays creation of an object until it is needed.
✓ Transaction Concurrency: Manages concurrent operations without conflicts.
✓ Process Isolation: Separates Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP).
✓ Data Replication: Involves duplicating data across systems for reliability and access.
```

### 5.2.2 Code Reviews

- **Code Review Checklists**: Primarily low-level and more effective when language-specific.
- Including code-level anti-patterns is helpful for less experienced developers.

Checklists used for code reviews could include the following items:

```markdown
• Structure

✓ Does the code completely and correctly implement the design?
✓ Does the code conform to any pertinent coding standards?
✓ Is the code well-structured, consistent in style, and consistently formatted?
✓ Are there any uncalled or unneeded procedures or any unreachable code?
✓ Are there any leftover stubs or test routines in the code?
✓ Can any code be replaced by calls to external reusable components or library functions?
✓ Are there any blocks of repeated code that could be condensed into a single procedure?
✓ Is storage use efficient?
✓ Are symbolics used rather than “magic number” constants or string constants?
✓ Are any modules excessively complex and should be restructured or split into multiple modules?

• Documentation

✓ Is the code clearly and adequately documented with an easy-to-maintain commenting style?
✓ Are all comments consistent with the code?
✓ Does the documentation conform to applicable standards?

• Variables

✓ Are all variables properly defined with meaningful, consistent, and clear names?
✓ Are there any redundant or unused variables?

• Arithmetic Operations

✓ Does the code avoid comparing floating-point numbers for equality?
✓ Does the code systematically prevent rounding errors?
✓ Does the code avoid additions and subtractions on numbers with greatly different magnitudes?
✓ Are divisors tested for zero or noise?

• Loops and Branches

✓ Are all loops, branches, and logic constructs complete, correct, and properly nested?
✓ Are the most common cases tested first in IF-ELSEIF chains?
✓ Are all cases covered in an IF-ELSEIF or CASE block, including ELSE or DEFAULT clauses?
✓ Does every case statement have a default?
✓ Are loop termination conditions obvious and invariably achievable?
✓ Are indices or subscripts properly initialized, just prior to the loop?
✓ Can any statements that are enclosed within loops be placed outside the loops?
✓ Does the code in the loop avoid manipulating the index variable or using it upon exit from the loop?

• Defensive Programming

✓ Are indices, pointers, and subscripts tested against array, record, or file bounds?
✓ Are imported data and input arguments tested for validity and completeness?
✓ Are all output variables assigned?
✓ Is the correct data element operated on in each statement?
✓ Is every memory allocation released?
✓ Are timeouts or error traps used for external device access?
✓ Are files checked for existence before attempting to access them?
✓ Are all files and devices left in the correct state upon program termination?
