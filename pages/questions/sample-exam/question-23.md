#### Correct Answer: a

    a. Is correct. Because reliability tests often require use of the entire system, reliability testing is most commonly performed as part of system testing
    b. Is not correct. Co-existence issues should be analyzed when planning the targeted production environment, but the actual tests are normally performed after system and user acceptance testing have been successfully completed
    c. Is not correct. Adaptability tests may be performed in conjunction with installability tests and are typically followed by functional tests to detect any faults which may have been introduced in adapting the software to a different environment
    d. Is not correct. Replaceability may also be evaluated by technical review or inspection at the architecture and design levels where the emphasis is placed on the clear definition of interfaces to potential replaceable components
