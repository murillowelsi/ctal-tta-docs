# Technical Test Analyst Exam

## [TTA-4.5.7: Performance Test Planning](../../4-quality-characteristics-for-technical-testing/4.5-performance-testing.md#457-performance-test-planning)

### Question #28 (1 Point) - K2

**Which of the following statements about code reviews in the context of planning performance efficiency testing is CORRECT?**

    a. Code reviews are not useful in performance efficiency testing, because performance can be measured only with dynamic testing on a running system
    b. Code reviews are useful in performance efficiency testing, because they may detect inefficient algorithm implementation that may cause performance issues
    c. Code reviews are not useful in performance efficiency testing, because performance efficiency testing usually requires the entire system to be implemented, so it is typically performed as part of system testing, which requires dynamic testing, not static testing
    d. Code reviews are useful in performance efficiency testing, because static testing is not dependent on the test environment, so the testers do not need to spend time on defining and building the test environment

**Select ONE option.**

#### Correct Answer: b

    a. Is not correct. Code reviews are useful in performance efficiency testing (see the justification for the correct answer)
    b. Is correct. According to syllabus (4.5.7) reviews are of particular relevance when planning performance efficiency tests. Performance issues may result from poorly designed code, for example from inefficient algorithms. Code reviews can detect such issues
    c. Is not correct. Code reviews are useful in performance efficiency testing (see the justification for the correct answer)
    d. Is not correct. The test environment has nothing to do with the fact that code reviews are useful in performance efficiency testing. Hence, although the statement that test environments do not need to be designed for code reviews is correct, this is not the reason that code reviews are useful for performance efficiency testing
