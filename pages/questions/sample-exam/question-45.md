#### Correct Answer: d

    a. Is not correct. An emulator is not restricted to initial functional tests – it can also be used for tests later in the life cycle, and for non-functional tests
    b. Is not correct. An emulator may allow functional as well as nonfunctional tests. Although most usability testing will and should be done on real devices, early usability tests such as a heuristic evaluation might be done using an emulator
