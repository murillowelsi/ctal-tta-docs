### Question #19 (3 Points) - K4

Assume you are working as a Technical Test Analyst on the system integration testing of the baggage handling system for a major airport. Most of the system components are developed by a main contractor, but the system components for baggage redirection and for handling outsized items are being developed off-shore by separate organizations.
The airport operator is the customer for the project and has indicated that the system must run fast even under peak morning and evening loads.
A fully representative test environment has been made available for the system integration tests and a specialist tools team has been set up to support the functional and nonfunctional testing. Some of the functional tests for systems integration have already been implemented but progress is slow.

**Based on this information, which of the following topics are you MOST likely to identify as risks in the system integration test plan?**

    a. Stakeholder requirements
    b. Required tool acquisition and training
    c. Test environment requirements
    d. Organizational considerations
    e. Data security considerations

**Select TWO options.**

    c. Is not correct. A fully representative test environment has been made available
    d. Is correct. If components are distributed across different sites and organizations, the effort required to plan and co-ordinate the system integration tests may be significant and must be addressed in the test planning
