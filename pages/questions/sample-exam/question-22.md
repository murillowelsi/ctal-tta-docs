### Question #22 (1 Point) - K2

**Which of the following statements is CORRECT?**

    b. Availability testing using operational profiles is performed both before and after entering operational service
    c. Security testing should start with component testing and go on through integration and system testing as security issues can be introduced anytime during development
    d. Maintainability can be evaluated early in the lifecycle without having to wait for a complete and running system

**Select ONE option.**

#### Correct Answer: d

    a. Is not correct. Performing turnaround time tests before a production-like test environment is available is not practical as any times recorded will be unlikely to be representative of the operational turnaround times
    b. Is not correct. Once the system is operational, the operational data can be used to determine availability, and so availability testing using operational profiles is unnecessary
    c. Is not correct. Security testing may be scheduled for the unit, integration and system testing levels, but for many projects it should start earlier with reviews and static analysis
    d. Is correct. Since maintainability is built into the code and the documentation for each individual code component maintainability can be evaluated early in the lifecycle without having to wait for a completed and running system
