### Question #24 (2 Points) - K3

Assume that you are working for a start-up company with big ambitions but with limited initial funding. They are creating a system that will provide customized loyalty and rewards programs for small- and medium-sized businesses selling to customers on the web. These companies enroll themselves on the system’s web store.

This allows the companies to create customized buttons, to be placed on their websites, that let customers enroll in the companies’ loyalty and rewards program. Each subsequent purchase earns points, and both companies and their customers can manage the program; for example, companies can determine the number of points required for customers to receive a free product or service, and customers can monitor their points.

Your employer’s marketing staff is heavily promoting the system, offering aggressive discounts on the first year’s fees to sign up new companies. The marketing materials state that the service will be highly reliable and extremely fast for companies and their customers.

At this time, the requirements are complete, and development of the software has just begun. The current schedule will allow companies and their customers to start enrolling in three months.

Your employer intends to use cloud computing resources to host this service, and to have no hardware resources other than ordinary office computers for its developers, testers, and other engineers and managers. Industry-standard web-based application software components will be used to build the system.

Assume that you are executing security tests against the system.

**Which of the following types of defect would you expect to find during this testing?**

    a. System clears screen too quickly after login
    b. System removes user temporary files after logout
    c. System allows unauthorized access to data
    d. System allows access from unsupported browser

**Select ONE option.**
