### Question #37 (1 Point) - K2

**Which of the following statements BEST captures the difference between data-driven and keyword-driven test automation?**

    a. Keyword-driven test automation can extend data-driven automation by defining keywords corresponding to actions in business processes
    b. Data-driven test automation extends keyword-driven automation by storing test data in spreadsheets or databases
    c. Data-driven test automation is more maintainable than keyword-driven test automation
    d. Keyword-driven test automation requires fewer skills to develop than data-driven test automation

#### Correct Answer: a

    a. Is correct. Keyword-driven tests can use a data-driven approach, but also have process-based keywords
    b. Is not correct. Data-driven test automation is not keyword-driven and so does not extend it. Keyword-driven testing requires test scripts that contain high-level keywords and supporting files (e.g., also data files) that contain low-level scripts, whereas data-driven testing only uses
    data files to contain the test data and expected results
    c. Is not correct. Keyword-driven tests are typically easier to maintain (due to the additional separation of business logic from test script implementation)
    d. Is not correct. Additional skills in the implementation of keywords as test automation code and the design of the keyword-driven framework mean that keyword-driven test automation typically requires more skills than data-driven test automation
