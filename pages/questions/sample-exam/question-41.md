### Question #41 (1 Point) - K2

**Which of the following statements about performance testing tools is CORRECT?**

    a. These tools drive the application at the communications protocol level rather than through its user interface to measure response times more accurately
    b. These tools generate a load by simulating many virtual users using operational profiles to generate input test data
    c. These tools capture a script from one individual user interaction and multiple identical copies of this script are then replayed in parallel to represent the full range of possible users
    d. These tools take a wide range of measurements after test execution to enable the analysis of the most significant performance characteristics of the test object

**Select ONE option.**

#### Correct Answer: b

    a. Is not correct. If the accurate measurement of response times was an issue, then the tools would have to drive the application using its user interface
    b. Is correct. Performance testing tools are used to generate defined loads based on operational profiles
    c. Is not correct. The script needs to be changed to take account of the variability of different users and their transactions
    d. Is not correct. Measurements need to be taken during execution
