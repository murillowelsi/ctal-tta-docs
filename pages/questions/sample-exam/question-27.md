#### Correct Answer: b

    a. Is not correct. The Product owner may have provided input on what the load is expected to be, but they are unlikely to know the expected load in sufficient detail
    b. Is correct. The operational profile should define how the system is expected to be used in normal conditions
    c. Is not correct. The Scrum Master may not be a subject matter expert on reliability and is unlikely to know the expected load in sufficient detail
    d. Is not correct. Although the test environment requirements will include the ability to generate loads based on the operational profile, they will not define those loads
