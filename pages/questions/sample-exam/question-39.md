## [TTA-6.1.1.3: Applying a Keyword-driven Approach](../../6-test-tools-and-automation/6.1-defining-the-test-automation-project.md#6113-applying-a-keyword-driven-approach)

### Question #39 (2 Points) - K3

Assume that you are involved in testing a mature application. This application is an online dating service that allows users: to enter a profile of themselves; to meet orientation-appropriate people who would be a good match for them; to arrange social events with those people; and, to block people they do not want to contact them.

Defects and test cases are managed in an existing commercial test management tool, which is working well. Source code and other project work products are stored in an open-source
configuration management system.

Your manager directs you to help her select a test execution automation tool to automate most of the regression testing.

Assume you are using a keyword-driven automation approach.

**Which of the options would be the MOST LIKELY keywords for this application?**

    a. Enter_Test_Data
    b. Remove_Test_Data
    c. Enter_Profile
    d. Find_Match
    e. Pay_Bill

**Select TWO options.**

    b. Is not correct. The keywords are supposed to be about the business process supported by the application, not the test process
    c. Is correct. It is explicitly mentioned in the scenario as being a capability of the application
    d. Is correct. It is explicitly mentioned in the scenario as being a capability of the application
    e. Is not correct. This might be a capability of the application, but it is not mentioned in the scenario, so it is not the most likely keyword on the list, and also since there was no mention that the product charges its customers
