#### Correct Answers: a

    a. Is correct. This is an example of co-existence testing, and co-existence is a sub-characteristic of compatibility
    b. Is not correct. This is an example of replaceability testing, and replaceability is a sub-characteristic of portability, not compatibility
    c. Is not correct. This is an example of functional testing. Compatibility testing is testing of a non-functional characteristic
    d. Is not correct. This may be relevant to maintainability testing but has nothing to do with compatibility testing
