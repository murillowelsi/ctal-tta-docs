A web-based holiday booking system expects to handle three times its average number of visitors during the peak month of the year.

    b. The expected peak load defined by the business analysts may be too high

#### Correct Answers: a, d

    a. Is correct. The ability of the web servers to support the expected peak number of transactions is a risk that can be addressed by performance testing
    b. Is not correct. If the expected peak load was defined to be too high (rather than too low), then it is unlikely to lead to a risk high enough to need mitigating by performance testing
    c. Is not correct. Re-using functional tests is not a reason for conducting performance tests. Being able to reuse test cases is a bonus, but not a reason. Performing the tests and analyzing the results is still extra effort that needs justification
    d. Is correct. People may abandon the site if their enquiry responses take too long, which may occur during the peak month. This is a risk that can be addressed by performance testing
    e. Is not correct. Having skills in performance testing tools is good, but it is not a reason to conduct performance tests
