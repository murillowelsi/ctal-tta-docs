There are two types of analysis: Static Analysis and Dynamic Analysis.

> Testing vs. Analysis
>
> Testing primarily involves identifying issues within a software.
>
> Analysis delves deeper into understanding the root causes behind those issues.

### Static analysis

- Static analysis is a form of testing that evaluates software without executing it.
- It assesses software quality based on form, structure, content, and documentation.
- Static analysis allows detailed analysis without executing test cases.
- Static testing techniques also include various forms of reviews.

### Dynamic analysis

- Dynamic analysis involves executing the code to find defects like memory leaks.
- Dynamic analysis may use tools or involve a person monitoring the system for issues like memory usage increases.
