Testing vs. Analysis

- Testing primarily involves identifying issues within a software.
- Analysis delves deeper into understanding the root causes behind those issues.
```

There are two types of analysis: Static Analysis and Dynamic Analysis.

## Static Testing vs Static Analysis

### Static Testing

- **Description**: Testing method where the software is not executed.
- **Approach**: Involves reviewing code, documentation, and design.
- **Methods**: Includes walkthroughs, reviews, inspections, and desk-checking.
- **Purpose**: Identifies errors early in the software development life cycle.

### Static Analysis

- **Description**: A subset of static testing using tools to examine code without executing it.
- **Tools**: Automated tools for detecting code defects and standard violations.
- **Application**: Enforces coding standards and identifies complex code areas.

## Dynamic Testing vs Dynamic Analysis

### Dynamic Testing

- **Description**: Testing method where the software is executed.
- **Types**: Includes functional testing (system, integration, acceptance) and non-functional testing (performance, load).
- **Objective**: Verifies software behavior under different conditions.

### Dynamic Analysis

- **Description**: A part of dynamic testing focused on evaluating software during execution.
- **Tools**: Tools used for monitoring software operation and detecting runtime issues.
- **Significance**: Crucial for understanding software behavior in a live environment.
