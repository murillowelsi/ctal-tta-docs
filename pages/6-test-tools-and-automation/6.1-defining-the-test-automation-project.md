## 6.1 Defining the Test Automation Project

```markdown
✓ Date Completed: 18/01/2024 - Understanding Level: 😊
```

- Test automation projects should be well-architected and designed to be cost-effective.
- Lack of a solid architecture can lead to costly, ineffective, and unsustainable automation tools.
- Treat test automation as a software development project with documentation, design, unit testing, and code reviews.
- Unstable or inaccurate test automation code can cause unnecessary delays and complications in testing.

- Technical Test Analyst's tasks in test execution automation include:

  - Determining who will be responsible for test execution (possibly in coordination with a TM).
  - Selecting appropriate automation tools based on organization, timeline, team skills, and maintenance needs (deciding to create a tool or than acquiring one?).
  - Defining interface requirements between automation tools like test management, defect management and CI.
  - Developing adapters to connect automation tools with the software under test.
  - Choosing an automation approach, such as keyword-driven or data-driven.
  - Estimating implementation costs, including training.
  - Creating schedules and allocating time for maintenance.
  - Training Test Analysts and Business Analysts in using and supplying data for automation.
  - Deciding when and how automated tests will be executed.
  - Combining automated test results with manual test results.

- TAE may handle many of these tasks in automation-focused projects.
- In agile the assignment of these tasks is more flexible and less formal.
- These activities and decisions impact the scalability and maintainability of the automation solution.
- Adequate research and understanding of available tools and technologies are crucial for making informed decisions.

### 6.1.1 Selecting the Automation Approach

```markdown
✓ Date Completed: 18/01/2024 - Understanding Level: 😊
```

- This section considers the following factors which impact the test automation approach:
  - Automating through the GUI, API and CLI
  - Applying a data-driven approach
  - Applying a keyword-driven approach
  - Handling software failures
  - Considering system state

#### 6.1.1.1 Automating through the GUI, API and CLI

```markdown
✓ Date Completed: 18/01/2024 - Understanding Level: 😊
```

- Test automation is not limited to testing through the GUI. Tools also exist to help automate testing at the API level, through a CLI and other interface points in the software under test.
- Technical Test Analysts must decide which interface is most suitable for automation.
- Adapters may be needed to connect general test execution tools to these interfaces.
- GUI testing can be challenging due to GUI changes during software evolution.

  - Example: If a button's position on a webpage changes, GUI automation scripts may fail unless they are updated to reflect the new location.

- Capture/playback tools can create automated test scripts but may require updates if GUI objects change.

  - Example: Using a capture/playback tool to automate a login process may record mouse clicks on login button. If the button's appearance or location changes, recorded scripts might fail, requiring adjustments.

- Capture/playback tools can serve as a starting point for automation and be improved for maintainability by replacing sections with reusable functions.
  - Example: Instead of recording every step of a test case, a tester can record the initial interaction and then create reusable functions for login, data input, and verification to enhance script maintainability.

#### 6.1.1.2 Applying a Data-driven Approach

```markdown
✓ Date Completed: 18/01/2024 - Understanding Level: 😊
```

- Applying a data-driven approach in software testing involves using a single automated test script for similar test steps with different data.

  - Example: Testing error handling for an input field by entering multiple invalid values (e.g., entering "abc123" and "!!@#$") and checking the error returned for each input.

- Instead of hardcoding data into scripts, data is stored externally, typically in a spreadsheet or database.
- Functions are written to access specific data for each test execution.
- A harness and infrastructure are required to support script execution.
- Test Analysts or business representatives create the actual data, allowing technical test analysts to focus on automation script implementation.
- Test Analysts usually execute the test scripts once automation is implemented and tested.

#### 6.1.1.3 Applying a Keyword-driven Approach

```markdown
✓ Date Completed: 18/01/2024 - Understanding Level: 😊
```

- Keyword-driven approach separates the action to be performed on test data from the test script.
- A high-level descriptive language is created for defining keywords.
- Keywords can be:
  - High-level business process actions (e.g., "Login," "CreateUser")
  - Lower-level GUI interactions (e.g., "ClickButton," "SelectFromList").
- Keywords may have parameters (e.g., "LogIn" with user_name and password parameters).
- Test automator (TTA or TAE) translates keywords into test automation code.
- Keywords, actions, and data can be stored in spreadsheets or entered using specific tools.
- Test automation framework implements keywords as executable functions or scripts.
- Tools read test cases written with keywords and call appropriate test functions or scripts.
- Highly modular implementation of executables allows easy mapping to specific keywords.
- The TTA, in the role as the test automator, can effectively apply programming skills without having to become a domain expert across many areas of the business.
- Separating business logic knowledge from programming improves test resource utilization.
- Insulating automation from changes enhances code maintainability and ROI.

#### 6.1.1.4 Handling Software Failures

```markdown
✓ Date Completed: 18/01/2024 - Understanding Level: 😊
```

- In test automation design, handling software failures is crucial.
- When a failure occurs, the test automator needs to make decisions on how to proceed.
- Anticipate and handle software failures in test automation.
- Decide how to respond when a failure occurs:

  - Record the failure?
  - Continue the tests?
  - Terminate the tests?
  - Take specific actions (e.g., clicking a button, adding delays) to handle the failure?

- Unhandled software failures can lead to:
  - Corrupted subsequent test results.
  - Problems with the ongoing test execution.

#### 6.1.1.5 Considering System State

```markdown
✓ Date Completed: 18/01/2024 - Understanding Level: 😊
```

- It is very important to consider the system state in testing.
- Need to return the system to a predefined state after test execution.
- Facilitates repetitive automated testing without manual intervention.
- Examples include deleting created data or altering database records after the tests (Setup and Teardown).
- Automation framework should ensure proper termination (e.g., logging out) after test completion.

### 6.1.2 Modeling Business Processes for Automation

```markdown
✓ Date Completed: 18/01/2024 - Understanding Level: 😊
```

- Implementing keyword-driven test automation requires modeling business processes in a high-level keyword language.

  - Language should be intuitive for Test Analysts or business representatives.
  - Keywords represent high-level interactions with a system.

- Examples of keywords:

  |    Keyword     |  User  | Password |               Result                |
  | :------------: | :----: | :------: | :---------------------------------: |
  |    Add_User    | User1  |  Pass1   |         User added message          |
  |    Add_User    | @Rec34 |  @Rec35  |         User added message          |
  | Reset_Password | User1  | Welcome  | Password reset confirmation message |
  |  Delete_User   | User1  | Invalid  |  Invalid username/password message  |
  |    Add_User    | User3  |  Pass3   |         User added message          |
  |  Delete_User   | User2  |    -     |       User not found message        |

- Considerations for keyword granularity:
  - Detailed keywords cover specific scenarios but may lead to complex maintenance.
  - Allowing low-level actions in keywords enhances flexibility but may require more maintenance due to GUI changes.
  - Aggregated keywords can simplify development but complicate maintenance.
- Addressing keyword changes and new additions is essential, involving both business logic and automation functionality.

- Keyword-based test automation reduces long-term maintenance costs, even if setup is initially costlier.
