- Operational profiles are an integral part of test specifications for various non-functional test types, such as reliability and performance testing. They are particularly useful when testing requirements include the constraint of operating 'under specified conditions', as these profiles help define these conditions.

### Definition and Components

- **Pattern of Use Definition**: An operational profile defines a pattern of usage for a system, focusing on the users and operations performed by the system.
- **User Specification**: Users are detailed in terms of numbers, usage timings, and types (like primary or secondary users).
- **Operations Specification**: The operations expected to be performed by the system are specified, including their frequency and probability of occurrence.

#### Data Gathering

- **Usage Monitoring Tools**: Information for operational profiles may be sourced from monitoring tools if a similar application is already available, or through predictions based on algorithms or business organization estimates.

### Application in Testing

- **Generation of Test Inputs**: Tools can generate test inputs based on the operational profile, often using pseudo-random approaches.
- **Creation of Virtual or Simulated Users**: These tools can create virtual users to match the operational profile for tests like reliability and availability, or exceed it for stress or capacity testing.

- **Further Reference**:
  - **Section 6.2.3**: For more detailed information on these tools and their applications in testing, refer to section 6.2.3.
