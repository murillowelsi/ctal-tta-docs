- Maintainability testing is crucial as software often spends more time being maintained than developed.
- It measures the ease of analyzing, changing, testing, modularizing, and reusing code.
- It differs from maintenance testing, which tests changes made to operational software.
- Stakeholders' objectives in maintainability testing include minimizing software ownership and operation costs and reducing downtime.

- Maintainability tests should be included in the test approach under specific conditions:

  - When software changes are likely after it enters production (e.g., defect corrections or updates).
  - When stakeholders believe that achieving maintainability objectives outweighs the testing and change costs.
  - When the risks of poor software maintainability justify conducting maintainability tests (e.g., long response times to user-reported defects).

Examples:

- If a software product frequently requires updates or bug fixes after release, maintainability testing should be part of the testing strategy.
- If stakeholders prioritize reducing the cost of software ownership, maintainability tests can help achieve this objective.
- When poor software maintainability leads to long response times for user-reported defects, it justifies conducting maintainability tests.

### 4.6.1 Static and Dynamic Maintainability Testing

- Static maintainability testing techniques: Static analysis and reviews.

  ```markdown
  Example: Using code reviews to identify coding issues early in the development process.
  ```

- Maintainability testing should start when design documentation is available and continue throughout code implementation.

  ```markdown
  Example: Evaluating code maintainability as code components are developed.
  ```

- Dynamic maintainability testing focuses on documented procedures for maintaining an application (e.g., software upgrades).

  ```markdown
  Example: Testing the process of upgrading software to ensure it meets service level requirements.
  ```

- Relevant in complex infrastructure environments and can be part of operational acceptance testing.

### 4.6.2 Maintainability Sub-characteristics

Maintainability can be measured in terms of:

- Analyzability

  ```markdown
  Example: Assessing how easily the code can be analyzed for issues.
  ```

- Modifiability

  ```markdown
  Example: Evaluating how easily code can be modified to meet changing requirements.
  ```

- Testability

  ```markdown
  Example: Determining how well the code can be tested for quality and functionality.
  ```

> Factors influencing these characteristics include good programming practices (e.g., commenting, naming) and technical documentation availability.

Other relevant quality sub-characteristics for maintainability per ISO 25010:

- Modularity

  ```markdown
  Example: Using static analysis to assess code modularity.
  ```

- Reusability

  ```markdown
  Example: Conducting architectural reviews to evaluate code reusability.
  ```
