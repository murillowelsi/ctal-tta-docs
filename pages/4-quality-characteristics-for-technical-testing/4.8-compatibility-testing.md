- Compatibility testing primarily deals with two aspects, as per ISO 25010:
  - Coexistence
  - Interoperability

### 4.8.2 Coexistence Testing

- Coexistence testing evaluates whether different computer systems, which are unrelated, can operate in the same environment (such as on the same hardware) without impacting each other‚Äôs behavior, including avoiding resource conflicts.

- **Relevance**: This form of testing is crucial when introducing new or upgraded software into environments with already installed applications.

#### Identification of Coexistence Issues

- Coexistence issues might not be apparent when an application is tested alone but can become evident when deployed in a production environment that runs other applications.

#### Objectives

- **Evaluating Impact on Functional Suitability**: Testing aims to assess the potential adverse effects on the functional suitability of applications when loaded in the same environment, like resource conflicts when a server runs multiple applications.

> Functional Suitability
>
> The degree to which a component or system provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions.

- **Impact of Operating System Fixes and Upgrades**: It also includes evaluating the impact of deploying operating system fixes and upgrades on applications.

- **Testing Process**:
  - **Planning and Analysis**: Coexistence issues should be considered during the planning phase for the targeted production environment.
  - **Execution Timing**: Actual coexistence tests are typically performed after system testing has been completed.
