- Security testing assesses a system's vulnerability to threats.
- Reasons for considering security testing include:
  - Unauthorized copying of applications or data.
  - Unauthorized access control (testing user rights, access, and privileges).
  - Identifying unintended side-effects in software functionality.
  - Detecting code inserted into web pages (cross-site scripting or XSS).
  - Identifying buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
  - Detecting denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
  - Preventing interception, mimicking, and altering of communications (man-in-the-middle attacks).
  - Breaking encryption codes used to protect sensitive data.
  - Identifying logic bombs (Easter Eggs) that activate under specific conditions, performing malicious acts.

### 4.3.2 Security Test Planning

```

- Security testing should be planned at various stages, including:
  - Component testing
  - Integration testing
  - System testing
  - Regular testing in production
- Test approaches may involve reviewing architecture, design, and code, and conducting static code analysis using security tools.
- Technical Test Analysts may need to design and execute security "attacks" in coordination with stakeholders.
- Obtaining explicit permission from the Test Manager is crucial for security test planning to avoid legal issues.
- Coordination with an organization's Information Security Officer is recommended.
- Improvements in system security may impact performance and reliability, necessitating additional testing.
- Specific standards, such as [IEC 62443-3-2], may apply to security test planning.

### 4.3.3 Security Test Specification

```

- Security tests can be categorized based on the origin of security risks:

  - User interface related: Unauthorized access and malicious inputs
  - File system related: Access to sensitive data stored in files or repositories
  - Operating system related: Storage of sensitive information in non-encrypted form in memory, which could be exposed during system crashes due to malicious inputs
  - External software related: Interactions among external components the system uses, either at the network level (e.g., incorrect packets or messages) or software component level (e.g., software component failure)

- ISO 25010 sub-characteristics of security (Confidentiality, Integrity, Non-repudiation, Accountability, Authenticity) provide a basis for specifying security tests.

  - Confidentiality: The degree to which a component or system ensures that data are accessible only to those authorized to have access.
  - Integrity: The degree to which a component or system allows only authorized access and modification to a component, a system or data.
  - Non-repudiation: The degree to which actions or events can be proven to have taken place, so that the actions or events cannot be repudiated later.
  - Accountability: The degree to which the actions of an entity can be traced uniquely to that entity.
  - Authenticity: The degree to which the identity of a subject or resource can be proved to be the one claimed.

- The recommended approach for developing security tests includes:

  - Gathering information such as employee names, physical addresses, network details, IP numbers, software/hardware details, and OS versions.
  - Performing vulnerability scans using available tools to identify vulnerabilities without compromising security (OWASP).
  - Developing "attack plans" to test system security, specifying various inputs via interfaces like user interfaces and file systems.
  - Attack plans may be developed for penetration testing.
