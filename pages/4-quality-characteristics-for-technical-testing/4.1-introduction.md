Summary with added tasks for Technical Test Analyst (TTA):

- The Technical Test Analyst (TTA) focuses on "how" a product works rather than "what" it does.
- Tests can be conducted at any level, including component testing, operational acceptance testing, and system testing.
- Testing should be performed based on risk priorities and available resources.
- Both dynamic and static testing (including reviews) can be used to assess non-functional quality characteristics.
- ISO 25010 provides a guide for quality characteristics and sub-characteristics.

- While the Test Manager compiles and reports summarized metric information concerning quality characteristics and sub-characteristics, the Test Analyst or the Technical Test Analyst (according to the table above) gathers the information for each metric.

- TTA tasks include:

  - **Reliability** (Maturity, Fault tolerance, Recoverability, Availability)
  - **Performance Efficiency** (Time behavior, Resource utilization, Capacity)
  - **Maintainability** (Analyzability, Modifiability, Testability, Modularity, Reusability)
  - **Portability** (Adaptability, Installability, Replaceability)
  - **Security** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Non-repudiation, Accountability, Authenticity)

- Quality characteristic testing requires careful planning, dedicated equipment, specialized tools, and expertise.
- Measurements of quality characteristics in pre-production tests may be used for Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
- Some tests may continue in the production environment, especially for performance and reliability testing.
