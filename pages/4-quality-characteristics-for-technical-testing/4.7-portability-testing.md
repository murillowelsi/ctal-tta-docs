- Portability Testing evaluates the ability of software to be transferred, adapted, or replaced in different environments.
- Essential for ensuring software compatibility and flexibility across various systems.

- **Sub-characteristics of Portability (according to ISO 25010)**:

  - **Installability**: Testing the ease of installing the software in a new environment.
  - **Adaptability**: Assessing the software's capacity to adapt to different environments.
  - **Replaceability**: Evaluating the feasibility of replacing a component within the software, such as changing the database management system.

- **Testing Scope and Sequence**:

  - Begins with individual components (testing the replaceability from one db managment system to another).
  - Scope expands as more code becomes available.
  - Installability testing may not be testable until all the components of the product are functionally working.

- **Design and Architecture Considerations**:
  - Portability needs to be integrated into the product from the early stages of design and architecture.
  - Conducting architecture and design reviews helps identify potential portability requirements and issues, such as dependencies on specific operating systems.

Sure, here's a summary of the key points from the section on Installability Testing:

- Installability testing focuses on evaluating the software and the procedures used for installing it in the target environment. This includes testing software designed for operating system installation or installation wizards for client PCs.

#### Objectives

- **Validation of Installation Process**: Ensuring the software can be installed as per the instructions in the manual or using an installation wizard, considering different hardware/software configurations and installation types (initial or update).
- **Handling Installation Failures**: Testing how installation failures (like loading errors of DLLs) are managed, ensuring they don't leave the system in an undefined state (like partial installation or wrong configurations).
- **Partial Installation/De-installation**: Verifying if partial installations or de-installations can be completed successfully.
- **Platform Identification**: Checking if the installation wizard accurately identifies invalid hardware platforms or operating system configurations.
- **Time and Step Efficiency**: Measuring if the installation can be completed within a set time frame or number of steps.
- **Software Downgrade and Uninstallation**: Validating that the software can be effectively downgraded or uninstalled.

#### Related Testing

- **Functional Suitability Testing**: Conducted post-installation to identify defects introduced during installation (like incorrect configurations or unavailable functions).
- **Usability Testing**: Usually performed alongside installability testing to ensure users receive clear instructions and error messages during installation.
