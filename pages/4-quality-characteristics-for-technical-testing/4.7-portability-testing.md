- Portability Testing evaluates the ability of software to be transferred, adapted, or replaced in different environments.
- Essential for ensuring software compatibility and flexibility across various systems.

- **Sub-characteristics of Portability (according to ISO 25010)**:

  - **Installability**: Testing the ease of installing the software in a new environment.
  - **Adaptability**: Assessing the software's capacity to adapt to different environments.
  - **Replaceability**: Evaluating the feasibility of replacing a component within the software, such as changing the database management system.

- **Testing Scope and Sequence**:

  - Begins with individual components (testing the replaceability from one db managment system to another).
  - Scope expands as more code becomes available.
  - Installability testing may not be testable until all the components of the product are functionally working.

- **Design and Architecture Considerations**:
  - Portability needs to be integrated into the product from the early stages of design and architecture.
  - Conducting architecture and design reviews helps identify potential portability requirements and issues, such as dependencies on specific operating systems.

### 4.7.2 Installability Testing

- Installability testing focuses on evaluating the software and the procedures used for installing it in the target environment. This includes testing software designed for operating system installation or installation wizards for client PCs.

#### Objectives

- **Validation of Installation Process**: Ensuring the software can be installed as per the instructions in the manual or using an installation wizard, considering different hardware/software configurations and installation types (initial or update).
- **Handling Installation Failures**: Testing how installation failures (like loading errors of DLLs) are managed, ensuring they don't leave the system in an undefined state (like partial installation or wrong configurations).
- **Partial Installation/De-installation**: Verifying if partial installations or de-installations can be completed successfully.
- **Platform Identification**: Checking if the installation wizard accurately identifies invalid hardware platforms or operating system configurations.
- **Time and Step Efficiency**: Measuring if the installation can be completed within a set time frame or number of steps.
- **Software Downgrade and Uninstallation**: Validating that the software can be effectively downgraded or uninstalled.

#### Related Testing

- **Functional Suitability Testing**: Conducted post-installation to identify defects introduced during installation (like incorrect configurations or unavailable functions).
- **Usability Testing**: Usually performed alongside installability testing to ensure users receive clear instructions and error messages during installation.

### 4.7.3 Adaptability Testing

```

- Adaptability testing is designed to verify if an application functions correctly in all its intended target environments, which includes different hardware, software, middleware, and operating systems.

- **Identification of Environments**: The process starts with identifying, configuring, and making available the intended target environments for the testing team.
- **Functional Test Cases**: A selection of functional test cases are used to exercise the various components present in each environment.

#### Focus Areas

- **Software Portability**: Adaptability also concerns the software‚Äôs ability to be ported to various specified environments following a predefined procedure.
- **Evaluation of Procedures**: Tests may be specifically designed to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of the porting procedure.

#### Objective

- The primary objective of adaptability testing is to ensure that the application operates as expected across a range of specified environments, thereby confirming its adaptability.

### 4.7.4 Replaceability Testing

```

- Replaceability testing assesses whether a new software component can successfully replace an existing one in a system. This type of testing is particularly important in systems that utilize commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software or in IoT (Internet of Things) applications.

#### Testing Approach

- **Parallel Execution with Functional Integration Tests**: Replaceability tests are often conducted alongside functional integration tests, especially when there are multiple alternative components available for integration into the system.
- **Technical Review or Inspection**: In addition to actual testing, replaceability can be evaluated through technical reviews or inspections, focusing on architecture and design levels.

#### Key Focus

- The main emphasis in replaceability testing is on the clear definition and understanding of the interfaces of the component intended to be replaced. This ensures that the new component can integrate seamlessly and function correctly within the existing system framework.
