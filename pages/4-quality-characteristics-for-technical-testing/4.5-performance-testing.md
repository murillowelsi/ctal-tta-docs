- ISO 25010 classification defines performance efficiency sub-characteristics:
  - time behavior
  - resource utilization
  - capacity
- Performance testing measures a system's or software's performance under specified conditions.
- Key resources monitored during performance testing include elapsed time, CPU time, memory, and bandwidth.

### 4.5.2 Testing for Time Behavior

- Testing for time behavior assesses system performance under specified operating conditions:
  - Elapsed time from receiving a request to the first response (response time).
    - (the time to start responding, not the time to complete the requested activity)
  - Turnaround time from activity start to completion (processing time).
  - Number of activities completed per unit of time (throughput rate)
    - (number of database operations per second)
- Maximum response times for different system functions are often specified as requirements.
- In complex systems with multiple steps (e.g., a pipeline), analyzing time taken for each step helps identify bottlenecks.

```markdown
Response Time = Elapsed Time + Turnaround Time
```

#### Example

- Let's consider a web application that needs to process a user's request to load a webpage. In this scenario:

```markdown
- Elapsed Time (time to start responding) = 2 seconds
- Turnaround Time (time to complete the loading process) = 5 seconds
```

Using the formula, we can calculate the Response Time:

```markdown
- Response Time = 2 seconds (Elapsed Time) + 5 seconds (Turnaround Time) = 7 seconds
```

- So, the response time for this web application's request is 7 seconds.
- If the maximum specified response time requirement for this function is, for example, 6 seconds, then this result indicates that the system is not meeting the response time requirement, and further analysis is needed to identify and address any bottlenecks in the processing steps causing the delay.
