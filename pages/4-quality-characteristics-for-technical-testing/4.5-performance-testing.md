- ISO 25010 classification defines performance efficiency sub-characteristics:
  - time behavior
  - resource utilization
  - capacity
- Performance testing measures a system's or software's performance under specified conditions.
- Key resources monitored during performance testing include elapsed time, CPU time, memory, and bandwidth.

### 4.5.2 Testing for Time Behavior

```markdown
‚úì Date Completed: 16/01/2024 - Understanding Level: üòä
```

- Testing for time behavior assesses system performance under specified operating conditions:
  - Elapsed time from receiving a request to the first response (response time).
    - (the time to start responding, not the time to complete the requested activity)
  - Turnaround time from activity start to completion (processing time).
  - Number of activities completed per unit of time (throughput rate)
    - (number of database operations per second)
- Maximum response times for different system functions are often specified as requirements.
- In complex systems with multiple steps (e.g., a pipeline), analyzing time taken for each step helps identify bottlenecks.

```javascript
Response Time = Elapsed Time + Turnaround Time
```

#### Example

- Let's consider a web application that needs to process a user's request to load a webpage. In this scenario:

```javascript
- Elapsed Time (time to start responding) = 2 seconds
- Turnaround Time (time to complete the loading process) = 5 seconds
```

Using the formula, we can calculate the Response Time:

```javascript
- Response Time = 2 seconds (Elapsed Time) + 5 seconds (Turnaround Time) = 7 seconds
```

- So, the response time for this web application's request is 7 seconds.
- If the maximum specified response time requirement for this function is, for example, 6 seconds, then this result indicates that the system is not meeting the response time requirement, and further analysis is needed to identify and address any bottlenecks in the processing steps causing the delay.

### 4.5.3 Testing for Resource Utilization

```markdown

```

- Testing for resource utilization assesses system/software performance under specific operating conditions.
- It measures:
  - CPU utilization (as a percentage of available CPU time).
  - Memory utilization (as a percentage of available memory).
  - I/O device utilization (as a percentage of available I/O device time).
  - Bandwidth utilization (as a percentage of available bandwidth).

### 4.5.4 Testing for Capacity

```markdown
‚úì Date Completed: 16/01/2024 - Understanding Level: üòä
```

- Testing for capacity measures maximum limits under specified operating conditions.
- Aspects tested include:
  - Transactions processed per unit of time (e.g., maximum of 687 words translated per minute).
  - Simultaneous users accessing the system (e.g., maximum of 1223 users).
  - New users added to the system per unit of time (e.g., maximum of 400 users added per second).

### 4.5.5 Common Aspects of Performance Testing

```markdown
‚úì Date Completed: 16/01/2024 - Understanding Level: üòä
```

- Performance testing involves assessing time behavior, resource utilization, and capacity of a system.
- Multiple measurements are often taken, and the mean value is reported due to time value fluctuations caused by background tasks.
- In some cases, more detailed analysis methods like variance or statistical measures may be used.
- Outliers may be investigated and discarded when necessary.
- Dynamic analysis can be employed to identify bottleneck-causing components, measure resource utilization, and determine maximum limits for capacity testing.

### 4.5.6 Types of Performance Testing

```markdown
‚úì Date Completed: 16/01/2024 - Understanding Level: üòä
```

- Performance testing has two main objectives:

  ```markdown
  1. Verify if the software meets specified acceptance criteria (e.g., web page load time).
  2. Provide insights to improve system efficiency (e.g., identifying bottlenecks).
  ```

- Previous sections (4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4) help determine acceptance criteria and establish baseline values.
- The following performance test types focus on providing information to developers regarding system behavior under various operational conditions.

#### 4.5.6.1 Load Testing

- Load testing focuses on the ability of a system to handle different loads.
- Loads are defined by the number of users or concurrent processes.
- Operational profiles help define these loads ().
- Measurement criteria: system's time behavior and resource utilization.
- Process involves starting with a low load and gradually increasing it.
- Key information for developers: unexpected changes in response times and resource usage>.

#### 4.5.6.2 Stress Testing

- There are two types of stress testing:

  ```markdown
  1. Load Testing: Testing system under maximum expected load, gradually increasing until failure.
  2. Robustness Testing: Testing system with compromised resources to assess performance.
  ```

- Load Testing may involve:
  - Increasing load until system fails (e.g., slow response times or crashes).
  - Stressing the system and then returning to normal load to check performance recovery.
- Robustness Testing involves:
  - Deliberately compromising system resources (e.g., reducing memory or bandwidth).
- Stress testing helps identify weak aspects of the system for potential upgrades.

#### 4.5.6.3 Scalability Testing

- Scalable system adapts to different loads
  - Example: scalable website
- Scaling up with increased demand
- Scaling down with decreased demand
- Similar to load testing
- Tests system's ability to handle changing loads
- More users than current hardware can handle

### 4.5.7 Performance Test Planning

```markdown
‚úì Date Completed: 16/01/2024 - Understanding Level: üòä
```

- In general, the following are of particular relevance when planning performance efficiency tests:

1. Timing:

- Performance tests usually require the entire system to be implemented and run in a representative test environment.
- Typically performed as part of system testing.

2. Reviews:

- Code reviews, especially those focusing on database interaction, component interaction, and error handling.
- Identifies performance efficiency issues like "wait and retry" logic and inefficient queries.
- Scheduled as soon as code is available, before dynamic testing.

  ```markdown
  Example: Identifying inefficient database queries during code review.
  ```

3. Early Testing:

- Some performance tests (e.g., CPU utilization for a critical component) may be part of component (unit) testing.
- Components identified as bottlenecks may be updated and re-tested in isolation during component testing.

  ```markdown
  Example: Testing CPU utilization of a critical module early in development.
  ```

4. Architecture Changes:

- Adverse results from performance testing can lead to system architecture changes.
- Early performance testing maximizes time to address architectural issues.

  ```markdown
  Example: Adjusting system architecture based on performance test results.
  ```

5. Costs:

- Tools and test environments can be expensive.
- May use temporary cloud-based test environments or "top-up" tool licenses.
- Test planning optimizes test duration to minimize costs.

  ```markdown
  Example: Renting cloud-based test environments to reduce expenses.
  ```

6. Test Environment:

- Ensure the test environment closely resembles the operational environment.
- Representative environment reduces challenges in scaling performance test results.

  ```markdown
  Example: Matching hardware and software configurations in the test environment.
  ```

7. Exit Criteria:

- Performance efficiency requirements may be derived from baselines or regulatory standards.
- Some requirements, like CPU and memory usage, may be specified by regulations.

  ```markdown
  Example: Setting CPU and memory usage limits based on regulatory standards.
  ```

8. Tools:

- Load generation tools are essential for performance testing.
- Useful for simulating large user loads and resource restrictions for stress testing.
- Ensure tools are compatible with the system's communication protocols.

  ```markdown
  Example: Using load generation tools to simulate high user traffic on a website.
  ```

### 4.5.8 Performance Test Specification

```markdown
‚úì Date Completed: 16/01/2024 - Understanding Level: üòä
```

- Performance testing focuses on testing the system under specific operating conditions.
- An operational profile defining expected system usage is essential for performance testing.
- Operational profiles are discussed in more detail in section 4.9.
- In performance testing, you may need to adjust the operational profile to simulate different scenarios, such as capacity testing or load testing.
- For capacity testing, you might override the operational profile to determine the system's user access capacity by increasing the number of users until the system becomes unresponsive.
- In load testing, you may gradually increase the volume of transactions to assess system performance.
