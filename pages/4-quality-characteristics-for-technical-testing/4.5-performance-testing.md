- ISO 25010 classification defines performance efficiency sub-characteristics:
  - time behavior
  - resource utilization
  - capacity
- Performance testing measures a system's or software's performance under specified conditions.
- Key resources monitored during performance testing include elapsed time, CPU time, memory, and bandwidth.

### 4.5.2 Testing for Time Behavior

```

- Testing for time behavior assesses system performance under specified operating conditions:
  - Elapsed time from receiving a request to the first response (response time).
    - (the time to start responding, not the time to complete the requested activity)
  - Turnaround time from activity start to completion (processing time).
  - Number of activities completed per unit of time (throughput rate)
    - (number of database operations per second)
- Maximum response times for different system functions are often specified as requirements.
- In complex systems with multiple steps (e.g., a pipeline), analyzing time taken for each step helps identify bottlenecks.

```javascript
Response Time = Elapsed Time + Turnaround Time
```

#### Example

- Let's consider a web application that needs to process a user's request to load a webpage. In this scenario:

```javascript
- Elapsed Time (time to start responding) = 2 seconds
- Turnaround Time (time to complete the loading process) = 5 seconds
```

Using the formula, we can calculate the Response Time:

```javascript
- Response Time = 2 seconds (Elapsed Time) + 5 seconds (Turnaround Time) = 7 seconds
```

- So, the response time for this web application's request is 7 seconds.
- If the maximum specified response time requirement for this function is, for example, 6 seconds, then this result indicates that the system is not meeting the response time requirement, and further analysis is needed to identify and address any bottlenecks in the processing steps causing the delay.

### 4.5.3 Testing for Resource Utilization

```

- Testing for resource utilization assesses system/software performance under specific operating conditions.
- It measures:
  - CPU utilization (as a percentage of available CPU time).
  - Memory utilization (as a percentage of available memory).
  - I/O device utilization (as a percentage of available I/O device time).
  - Bandwidth utilization (as a percentage of available bandwidth).

### 4.5.4 Testing for Capacity

```

- Testing for capacity measures maximum limits under specified operating conditions.
- Aspects tested include:
  - Transactions processed per unit of time (e.g., maximum of 687 words translated per minute).
  - Simultaneous users accessing the system (e.g., maximum of 1223 users).
  - New users added to the system per unit of time (e.g., maximum of 400 users added per second).

### 4.5.5 Common Aspects of Performance Testing

```

- Performance testing involves assessing time behavior, resource utilization, and capacity of a system.
- Multiple measurements are often taken, and the mean value is reported due to time value fluctuations caused by background tasks.
- In some cases, more detailed analysis methods like variance or statistical measures may be used.
- Outliers may be investigated and discarded when necessary.
- Dynamic analysis can be employed to identify bottleneck-causing components, measure resource utilization, and determine maximum limits for capacity testing.

### 4.5.6 Types of Performance Testing

```markdown

```

- Performance testing has two main objectives:

  1. Verify if the software meets specified acceptance criteria (e.g., web page load time).
  2. Provide insights to improve system efficiency (e.g., identifying bottlenecks).

- Previous sections (4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4) help determine <u>acceptance criteria</u> and <u>establish baseline values</u>.
- The following performance test types focus on providing information to developers regarding system behavior under various operational conditions.

#### 4.5.6.1 Load Testing

- Load testing focuses on the ability of a system to handle different loads.
- <u>Loads</u> are defined by the number of users or concurrent processes.
- Operational profiles help define these loads (see section 4.9).
- Measurement criteria: system's time behavior and resource utilization.
- Process involves starting with a low load and gradually increasing it.
- Key information for developers: <u>unexpected changes in response times</u> and <u>resource usage</u>>.
