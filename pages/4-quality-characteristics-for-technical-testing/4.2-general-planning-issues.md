- Failure to plan for non-functional testing poses a significant project risk.
- Technical Test Analyst may assist Test Manager in identifying risks related to quality characteristics.
- This information helps in creating the master test plan.
- Key factors to consider:
  - Stakeholder requirements
  - Test environment requirements
  - Required tool acquisition and training
  - Organizational considerations
  - Data security considerations

### 4.2.1 Stakeholder Requirements

- Non-functional requirements are often poorly specified or missing in the planning stage.
- Technical Test Analysts should obtain expectation levels for technical quality characteristics from stakeholders.
- Evaluating the risks associated with non-functional requirements is crucial.
- It's common to assume that customer satisfaction with the existing system sets a benchmark for new versions.
- This approach is especially useful for non-functional quality characteristics like performance efficiency.
- Multiple viewpoints should be considered when capturing non-functional requirements.
- Key stakeholders such as customers, product owners, users, operations staff, and maintenance staff should be involved.
- Excluding key stakeholders may result in missing requirements.
- In agile software development, non-functional requirements can be expressed as user stories or added to use cases as non-functional constraints.

### 4.2.2 Test Environment Requirements

- Various technical tests (security, reliability, performance efficiency) require a production-like test environment.
- The size and complexity of the system impact test planning and funding.
- Options to consider for cost-effective environments:
  - Using the production environment
  - Using a scaled-down version of the system while ensuring representative results.
  - Utilizing cloud-based resources as an alternative to direct acquisition.
  - Implementing virtualized environments.
- Careful planning is needed for test execution times, with some tests only feasible during specific low-usage periods.

### 4.2.3 Required Tool Acquisition and Training

- Tools are essential for the test environment, especially in performance and security testing.
- Technical Test Analysts need to estimate costs and time for acquiring, learning, and implementing tools.
- Specialized tools require planning for learning curves and potentially hiring external specialists.
- Developing a complex simulator (like JMeter) is a separate project, with testing and documentation included in the schedule and resources.
- Budget and time should be allocated for upgrading and retesting the simulator as the product changes.
- Safety-critical applications with simulators should consider acceptance testing and possible certification by an independent body.

### 4.2.4 Organizational Considerations

```

- Technical tests involve measuring behavior of multiple system components.
- Components can be distributed across various sites and organizations.
- Planning and coordinating these tests may require significant effort.
- Software components may have time constraints for testing availability.
- For example, certain software components may only be available for system testing at a particular time of day, or organizations may only offer support for testing for a limited number of days.
- Failing to confirm that system components and staff (i.e., “borrowed” expertise) from other organizations are available “on call” for testing purposes may result in severe disruption to the scheduled tests.

### 4.2.5 Data Security and Data Protection

- Consider specific security measures during test planning.
- For example, the use of data encryption may make the creation of test data and the verification of results difficult.
- Data protection policies and laws may restrict using production data for testing (e.g., personal data, credit card data).
- Anonymizing test data is a challenging task and should be planned during test implementation.
