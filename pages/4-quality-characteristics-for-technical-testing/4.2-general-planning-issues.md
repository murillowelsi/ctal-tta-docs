- Failure to plan for non-functional testing poses a significant project risk.
- Technical Test Analyst may assist Test Manager in identifying risks related to quality characteristics.
- This information helps in creating the master test plan.
- Key factors to consider:
  - Stakeholder requirements
  - Test environment requirements
  - Required tool acquisition and training
  - Organizational considerations
  - Data security considerations

### 4.2.1 Stakeholder Requirements

- Non-functional requirements are often poorly specified or missing in the planning stage.
- Technical Test Analysts should obtain expectation levels for technical quality characteristics from stakeholders.
- Evaluating the risks associated with non-functional requirements is crucial.
- It's common to assume that customer satisfaction with the existing system sets a benchmark for new versions.
- This approach is especially useful for non-functional quality characteristics like performance efficiency.
- Multiple viewpoints should be considered when capturing non-functional requirements.
- Key stakeholders such as customers, product owners, users, operations staff, and maintenance staff should be involved.
- Excluding key stakeholders may result in missing requirements.
- In agile software development, non-functional requirements can be expressed as user stories or added to use cases as non-functional constraints.

### 4.2.2 Test Environment Requirements

- Tools are essential for the test environment, especially in performance and security testing.
- Technical Test Analysts need to estimate costs and time for acquiring, learning, and implementing tools.
- Specialized tools require planning for learning curves and potentially hiring external specialists.
- Developing a complex simulator is a separate project, with testing and documentation included in the schedule and resources.
- Budget and time should be allocated for upgrading and retesting the simulator as the product changes.
- Safety-critical applications with simulators should consider acceptance testing and possible certification by an independent body.

Simulators examples

1. **Mobile Device Emulators:** Emulators like Android Virtual Device (AVD) or Apple's Xcode simulator simulate mobile device characteristics and operating systems for mobile app testing.
2. **Load and Performance Testing Simulators:** Tools like Apache JMeter simulate a high volume of user interactions to test how a system handles loads and stress conditions.
3. **Simulated User Environments:** Simulators like Selenium WebDriver or Appium simulate user interactions with web or mobile applications, allowing for automated testing of user interfaces.

These simulators help testers assess how software or systems behave in different conditions or scenarios without needing the actual hardware or environments, making it easier to identify and address potential issues.
