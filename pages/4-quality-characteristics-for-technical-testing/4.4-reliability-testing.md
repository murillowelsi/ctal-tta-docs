# Chapter 4: Quality Characteristics for Technical Testing

## 4.4 Reliability Testing

### 4.4.1 Introduction

- ISO 25010 classification identifies reliability sub-characteristics: maturity, availability, fault tolerance, and recoverability.
- Reliability testing evaluates a system or software's capability to perform defined functions under specific conditions for a designated duration.

- Maturity: The degree to which a component or system meets needs for reliability under normal operation.
- Availability: The degree to which a component or system is operational and accessible when required for use.
- Fault tolerance: The ability to operate as intended despite the presence of hardware or software faults.
- Recoverability: The ability to recover data after interruption or failure and restore desired state.
```

### 4.4.2 Testing for Maturity

- Maturity in testing refers to the system's reliability under normal operation conditions.
- Operational profiles are typically used to specify reliability requirements.
  - For example, in an e-commerce system, the operational profile might specify that the system should handle 10,000 simultaneous users during peak hours without any critical errors.
- Maturity measures often serve as release criteria for systems.
  - For example, the app should have an average crash rate of less than 1% during beta testing.
- It's commonly applied in high-reliability systems like safety-critical functions.
- High-reliability systems might have a maturity goal defined by regulatory standards.
- Reliability growth modeling is the usual approach for testing maturity.
- Testing for maturity occurs after testing for other quality characteristics and defect fixes.
- This statistical approach aims to predict Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).
- Test inputs are generated based on the operational profile.
- Testing is conducted in an environment close to the operational one.
- Reducing failure frequency helps predict MTBF using reliability growth models.
- For lower reliability systems, the number of failures during expected operational use may be considered.
- Service level agreements (SLAs) may include recording and monitoring high-impact failures.

### 4.4.3 Testing for Availability

- Availability is the measure of the time a system or software is available to users and other systems under normal conditions.
- Systems may have low maturity but still achieve high availability.
- Availability is often specified as part of an SLA and measured for operational systems like websites and SaaS applications.
- Availability can be described as a percentage (e.g., 99.999% or 'five nines') or in terms of unavailability (e.g., not more than 60 minutes per month).
- Measuring availability before operation is done using tests based on expected usage over a prolonged period, in an environment close to the operational one.
- Availability can be calculated as MTTF/(MTTF + MTTR), where:
  - MTTF is the mean time to failure
  - MTTR is the mean time to repair (often measured in maintainability testing).
- In high-reliability systems with recoverability, mean time to recover can substitute for MTTR in the availability calculation.

### 4.4.4 Testing for Fault Tolerance

- High-reliability systems use fault tolerance to minimize downtime during failures.
- Fault tolerance testing involves simulating failures to check system resilience.
- Identifying potential failure conditions is crucial in fault tolerance testing.
- Fault-tolerant designs often include duplicate subsystems to provide redundancy.
- N-version programming is used to develop independent duplicate software systems.
- Critical systems may have multiple levels of redundancy, hardware reliability considerations.
- Fault tolerance testing checks both failure detection and system response.
- Fault injection testing tests system robustness against environmental and internal defects.
- It involves deliberately injecting defects to ensure the system reacts as expected, even for unlikely scenarios.

### 4.4.5 Testing for Recoverability

```

- Recoverability measures a system's ability to recover from a failure in terms of time and data loss.
- Approaches to recoverability testing include failover testing and backup and restore testing.
- Backup and restore testing focuses on evaluating procedures for data backup and restoration.
- Failover testing is performed when a primary system has a failover system in case of failure.
- Disaster recovery testing is a type of failover testing for catastrophic failures, often in a different location.
- Full disaster recovery tests require careful planning due to risks and disruption.
- Failover tests also include testing the move to the failover system and ensuring the required service level is provided.

### 4.4.6 Reliability Test Planning

```

- Timing: Reliability testing takes time and should occur after other test types.
- Costs: Testing high-reliability systems can be expensive due to long test durations.
- Duration: It takes a while to obtain statistically significant results for high-reliability levels.
- Test environment: Ensure the test environment mirrors the operational one, but it can disrupt users.
- Scope: Different subsystems/components may have varying reliability requirements.
- Exit criteria: Set reliability requirements based on regulatory safety standards.
- Failure: Define what constitutes a failure to count them accurately.
- Developers: Agreement with developers that identified defects are fixed as soon as possible.
- Measuring operational reliability is simpler than pre-release reliability, focusing on failures.
- Early testing: Start testing as early as possible, including reviews and code static analysis.

### 4.4.7 Reliability Test Specification

```

- Reliability Test Specification focuses on testing maturity and availability.
- Testing under normal operating conditions is the primary approach.
- An operational profile defining expected system usage is needed.
- Fault tolerance and recoverability testing require replicating failures.
- Fault injection testing is commonly used for this purpose.

- Techniques that helps identifying defects and failures:
  - Fault Tree Analysis
  - Failure Mode
  - Effect Analysis
