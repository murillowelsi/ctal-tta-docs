# 2.5 Multiple Condition Testing

- [x] **Date Completed:** 09/01/2024 - **Understanding Level:** 😊

  - Multiple condition testing is used to test all possible combinations of atomic conditions in a decision.
  - It requires exercising a decision 2<sup>N</sup> times, where N is the number of unique, mutually independent atomic conditions.
  - Coverage is measured as the percentage of exercised atomic condition combinations over all decisions in the test object.
  - **Applicability:** This technique is used for high-risk and embedded software expected to run reliably for extended periods.
  - **Limitations:** large number of test cases required and potential reduction in condition combinations due to short-circuiting in compilers.

  - Applying the **Multiple Condition Testing** technique to the scenario `(A && (B | C))`

    | Tests | A   | B   | C   | Outcome |
    | ----- | --- | --- | --- | ------- |
    | 1     | T   | T   | T   | T       |
    | 2     | T   | T   | F   | T       |
    | 3     | T   | F   | T   | T       |
    | 4     | T   | F   | F   | F       |
    | 5     | F   | T   | T   | F       |
    | 6     | F   | T   | F   | F       |
    | 7     | F   | F   | T   | F       |
    | 8     | F   | F   | F   | F       |

- Minimum Test Cases for 100% Multiple Condition Testing coverage is 2<sup>N</sup>
- N is the number of conditions
- In this case above we should have 8 test cases -> 2<sup>8</sup>
