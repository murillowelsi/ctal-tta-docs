### Key Concepts

- Multiple condition testing is used to test all possible combinations of atomic conditions in a decision.
- It requires exercising a decision 2<sup>N</sup> times, where N is the number of unique, mutually independent atomic conditions.
- Coverage is measured as the percentage of exercised atomic condition combinations over all decisions in the test object.

## Applicability

- This technique is used for high-risk and embedded software expected to run reliably for extended periods.

## Limitations/Difficulties

- Large number of test cases required and potential reduction in condition combinations due to short-circuiting in compilers.

- Applying the **Multiple Condition Testing** technique to the scenario `(A && (B | C))`

  | Tests |  A  |  B  |  C  | Outcome |
  | :---: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-----: |
  |   1   |  T  |  T  |  T  |    T    |
  |   2   |  T  |  T  |  F  |    T    |
  |   3   |  T  |  F  |  T  |    T    |
  |   4   |  T  |  F  |  F  |    F    |
  |   5   |  F  |  T  |  T  |    F    |
  |   6   |  F  |  T  |  F  |    F    |
  |   7   |  F  |  F  |  T  |    F    |
  |   8   |  F  |  F  |  F  |    F    |

- Minimum Test Cases for 100% Multiple Condition Testing coverage is 2<sup>N</sup>
- N is the number of conditions
- In this case above we should have 8 test cases -> 2<sup>3</sup>
