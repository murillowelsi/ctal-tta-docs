## 2.1 Introduction

- [x] **Date Completed:** 08/01/2024 - **Understanding Level:** ðŸ˜Š
  - White-box test techniques apply to code and structures with control flow.
  - Techniques enable systematic test case derivation and focus on specific aspects of the structure.
  - Test cases aim to satisfy coverage criteria and achieve full coverage.
  - Test inputs are generated to exercise specific parts of the code.
  - Expected results are determined based on external sources like requirements or design specifications.
  - Techniques covered in the syllabus include:
    - Statement testing
    - Decision testing
    - Modified condition/decision testing
    - Multiple condition testing
    - API testing
  - Foundation Syllabus introduces statement and decision testing.
  - Modified condition/decision and multiple condition techniques detect defects based on decision predicates.
  - [ISO 29119] provides more details and examples for these techniques.
