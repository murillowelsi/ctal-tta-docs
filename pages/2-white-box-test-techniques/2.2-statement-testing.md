### Key Concepts

- Exercises executable statements in code.
- Coverage measured by executed vs. total executable statements percentage.
- Full statement coverage is ideal but challenging.
- High coverage might not detect all code logic defects.
- Unreachable code affects 100% coverage achievement.
- Time and effort constraints impact coverage goals.
- Possible undetected defects even with high coverage.

## Statement Coverage Example

- Example of a Js function:

  ```js
  function divide(a, b) {
    let result = 0;
    if (b !== 0) {
      result = a / b;
    }
    return result;
  }
  ```

- Coverage involves executing statements within the if block.
- 100% coverage may not guarantee identification of all issues, like negative values or edge cases.

## Applicability

- Achieving full statement coverage should be considered as a minimum for all code being tested, although this is not always possible in practice.

  ```javascript
  (Number of ELSEs + 1)
  ```

## Limitations/Difficulties

- **Limited Time/Effort:**
  - If you have a large codebase, testing every statement may take too long or require too much effort, making it impractical.
- **Incomplete Coverage:**

  - 100% coverage doesn't ensure testing of all paths and edge cases.

  - Example of unreachable code:

    ```js
    function unreachableExample(x) {
      if (x > 0) {
        return "x is positive";
        console.log("This code will never be reached");
      } else {
        return "x is non-positive";
      }
    }
    console.log(unreachableExample(5)); // Output: "x is positive"
    ```

- Impossible to achieve 100% coverage due to mutually exclusive branches.
