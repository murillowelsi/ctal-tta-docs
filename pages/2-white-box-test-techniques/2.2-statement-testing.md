### Key Concepts

- Exercises executable statements in code.
- Coverage measured by executed vs. total executable statements percentage.
- Full statement coverage is ideal but challenging.
- High coverage might not detect all code logic defects.
- Unreachable code affects 100% coverage achievement.
- Time and effort constraints impact coverage goals.
- Possible undetected defects even with high coverage.

## Statement Coverage Example

- Example of a Python function:

  ```python
  def divide(a, b):
      result = 0
      if b != 0:
          result = a / b
      return result
  ```

- Coverage involves executing statements within the if block.
- 100% coverage may not guarantee identification of all issues, like negative values or edge cases.

## Applicability

- Achieving full statement coverage should be considered as a minimum for all code being tested, although this is not always possible in practice.

## Limitations/Difficulties

- **Limited Time/Effort:**
  - If you have a large codebase, testing every statement may take too long or require too much effort, making it impractical.
- **Incomplete Coverage:**

  - 100% coverage doesn't ensure testing of all paths and edge cases.
  - Example of missing "Division by zero!" message:

    ```python
    def divide(a, b):
        result = 0
        if b != 0:
            result = a / b
        else:
            print("Division by zero!")
        return result
    ```

  - Example of unreachable code:

    ```python
    def unreachable_example(x):
        if x > 0:
            print("x is positive")
        else:
            print("x is non-positive")
    ```

- Impossible to achieve 100% coverage due to mutually exclusive branches.
