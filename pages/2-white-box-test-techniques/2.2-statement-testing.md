# 2.2 Statement Testing

- [x] **Date Completed:** 08/01/2024 - **Understanding Level:** ðŸ˜Š
  - Statement testing exercises executable statements in code.
  - Coverage is measured as the ratio of executed statements to total executable statements (expressed as a percentage).
  - Achieving full statement coverage is ideal but not always possible due to time or effort constraints.
  - High percentages of statement coverage may still miss some defects in code logic.
  - Unreachable code can make achieving 100% statement coverage impossible, often due to default cases in switch statements when all possible cases are explicitly handled.
  - Constraints on available time and effort can limit achieving full statement coverage.
  - Certain defects in code logic may go undetected even with high statement coverage.

## Statement Coverage Example

- Consider a simple Python function:

```python
def divide(a, b):
    result = 0
    if b != 0:
        result = a / b
    return result
```

- In this code, the executable statements are the ones inside the if block. Statement coverage would involve executing those statements.
- However, achieving 100% statement coverage may not guarantee that all potential issues are caught, such as checking for negative values or other edge cases.

## Limitations/Difficulties

- **Limited Time/Effort:** If you have a large codebase, testing every statement may take too long or require too much effort, making it impractical.
- **Incomplete Coverage:** Achieving 100% statement coverage may not guarantee that all code paths and edge cases are tested. For example:

```python
def divide(a, b):
    result = 0
    if b != 0:
        result = a / b
    else:
        print("Division by zero!")
    return result
```

- Even with 100% statement coverage, you may miss testing the "Division by zero!" message.

```python
def unreachable_example(x):
    if x > 0:
        print("x is positive")
    else:
        print("x is non-positive")
```

- Achieving 100% statement coverage here is impossible because only one of the if or else branches will ever be executed, not both.
