### Key Concepts

- Decision testing focuses on testing decision outcomes in code.
- Test cases follow control flows from decision points **(e.g., IF, CASE, LOOP statements)**.
- Coverage is measured as a percentage of decision outcomes exercised by tests.
- It evaluates TRUE and FALSE outcomes of decisions, regardless of internal complexity.
- Branch testing is often used interchangeably with decision testing and covers control flow branches.
- For programs with no decisions, ISO 29119-4 requires at least one test to achieve 100% decision coverage.

## Applicability

- Critical code and any models with decision points.

## Limitations/Difficulties

- Not considering details of decisions with multiple conditions and potential defect detection issues.
- If you have nested IF decisions, you can use a simple formula to solve the exercise.

  ```javascript
  (Number of IFs + 1)
  ```

## Decision Testing Example

- How many test cases would you design to achieve 100% decision coverage?

  ```javascript
  IF A THEN
      IF B THEN
          Statement Q
      ELSE
          Statement R
      ENDIF
  ELSE
      Statement S
      IF C THEN
          Statement T
      ELSE
          Statement U
      ENDIF
  ENDIF
  Statement V
  ```

- Minimum test cases for a 100% Decision Coverage = **4**
- Number of IFs = **3** + **1** = **4 Test Cases**
