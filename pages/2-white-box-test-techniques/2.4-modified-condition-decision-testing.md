### Key Concepts

- Modified Condition/Decision Testing (MC/DC) is a testing technique that focuses on how decisions are structured, especially when they contain multiple conditions.
- Each decision predicate consists of one or more atomic conditions, and MC/DC checks if each atomic condition independently influences the decision's outcome.
- It provides stronger coverage than statement and decision coverage when dealing with decisions with multiple conditions.
- Achieving MC/DC typically requires testing a decision N+1 times, assuming N unique, mutually independent atomic conditions.

## Applicability

- MC/DC is especially useful in safety-critical industries like aerospace and automotive, where software failures can have catastrophic consequences.

## Limitations/Difficulties

- Difficulties may arise when multiple occurrences of the same variable in a decision with multiple conditions are coupled, making it challenging to achieve MC/DC.
- Some compilers or interpreters exhibit short-circuiting behavior, which can affect MC/DC testing by preventing the evaluation of all conditions in a decision.
- Configuring compilers to disable short-circuiting may not be allowed in safety-critical applications where code testing and delivered code must be identical.

- Applying the Modified Condition/Decision Testing (MC/DC) technique to the scenario `(A && (B | C))`

  | Tests |  A  |  B  |  C  | Outcome |
  | :---: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-----: |
  |   1   |  T  |  T  |  T  |    T    |
  |   2   |  T  |  T  |  F  |    T    |
  |   3   |  T  |  F  |  T  |    T    |
  |   4   |  T  |  F  |  F  |    F    |
  |   5   |  F  |  T  |  T  |    F    |
  |   6   |  F  |  T  |  F  |    F    |
  |   7   |  F  |  F  |  T  |    F    |
  |   8   |  F  |  F  |  F  |    F    |

```javascript
- For A: {1,5} {2,6} {3,7} `This demonstrates that A independently affects the outcome.`
- For B: {2,4} `This demonstrates that B independently affects the outcome.`
- For C: {3,4} `This demonstrates that C independently affects the outcome.`
- Minimizing the test cases: {2,3,4,6}
```

- Minimum Test Cases for 100% Modified Condition/Decision Testing is N + 1
- N is the number of conditions
- In this case above we should have 4 test cases
