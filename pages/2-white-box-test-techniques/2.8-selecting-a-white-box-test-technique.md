### Key Concepts

- White-box test techniques are selected based on required coverage levels.
  - For instance, a requirement to achieve 100% statement coverage would typically lead to the use of **statement testing**.
- Black-box test techniques are usually applied first, and white-box testing is used if required coverage is not achieved.

- Specifying a 100% white-box coverage level in testing requirements is considered good practice. This means that every part of the code should be exercised by testing.
  - When lower levels of coverage (e.g., 80%) are specified, it may leave out parts of the code that are the most challenging to test.
  - These often include complex and error-prone sections of the code.
  - The reason for preferring 100% coverage is that it ensures that even the most problematic portions of the code are thoroughly tested, reducing the chances of undetected defects.
- ISO 29119-4 allows for discounting infeasible coverage items, making 100% coverage achievable.
- When defining the necessary white-box coverage for a test object, you can choose to focus on a single coverage criterion rather than requiring both 100% statement coverage and 100% MC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage), which can be overly stringent and complex.

  - The concept of exit criteria at 100% coverage allows you to establish a hierarchy of coverage criteria, where some criteria are proven to subsume others. Subsumption means that if you achieve a higher-level criterion, it automatically implies the satisfaction of a lower-level one.

    ```markdown
    - Examples of coverage criterion subsumption:
      - Branch Coverage --> Statement Coverage
      - Decision Coverage --> Branch Coverage --> Statement Coverage
      - MC/DC --> Decision Coverage --> Branch Coverage --> Statement Coverage
      - Multiple Condition Coverage --> MC/DC --> Decision Coverage --> Branch Coverage --> Statement Coverage
    ```

- Different parts of a system may have different white-box coverage levels based on their risk contribution.
  - Subsystems related to in-flight entertainment in an avionics system have lower risk levels than those related to flight control.
  - Testing interfaces is common and required for all integrity levels in safety-related systems.
  - The level of required coverage for API testing increases with the associated risk, especially for public interfaces.
- Selection of white-box test technique depends on the nature of the test object and perceived risks.
  - Regulatory standards define required white-box coverage levels for safety-related test objects.
  - For non-safety-related test objects, coverage levels should be based on perceived risks.

### 2.8.1 Non-Safety-Related Systems

- Factors considered when selecting white-box test techniques for non-safety-related systems include:
  - Contract requirements for coverage
  - Customer requests for coverage
  - Regulatory standards in certain industry sectors
  - Alignment with the organization's test strategy
  - Coding style and complexity of the code
  - Historical defect data on achieving coverage levels
  - Tester skills and experience with white-box techniques
  - Availability of coverage measurement tools
- _Technical Test Analyst has more freedom to recommend white-box coverage for non-safety-related systems than for safety-related systems._
- Decisions on white-box testing coverage for non-safety-related systems are based on a compromise between perceived risks and the resources, cost, and time required for testing. Other testing approaches or development methods may be more suitable in some cases.

### 2.8.2 Safety-related systems

- For software in safety-related systems, regulatory standards define required coverage levels.
- Hazard analysis is performed to assess risks, and integrity levels are assigned to system parts.
- IEC 61508 is an international standard used for safety-related systems, but specific industry variants and standards exist (e.g., ISO 26262 for automotive, DO-178C for airborne software).
- IEC 61508 defines four _Safety Integrity Levels (SILs)_ based on risk reduction and hazard severity.

  | IEC 61508 SIL | Continuous Operation (probability of a dangerous failure per hour) | On-Demand (probability of failure on demand) |
  | :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------: |
  |       1       |                ‚â•10<sup>-6</sup> to <10<sup>-5</sup>                |     ‚â•10<sup>-2</sup> to <10<sup>-1</sup>     |
  |       2       |                ‚â•10<sup>-7</sup> to <10<sup>-6</sup>                |     ‚â•10<sup>-3</sup> to <10<sup>-2</sup>     |
  |       3       |                ‚â•10<sup>-8</sup> to <10<sup>-7</sup>                |     ‚â•10<sup>-4</sup> to <10<sup>-3</sup>     |
  |       4       |                ‚â•10<sup>-9</sup> to <10<sup>-8</sup>                |     ‚â•10<sup>-5</sup> to <10<sup>-4</sup>     |

- Higher-risk functions require higher reliability, and SIL 4 demands extremely high reliability.
- Recommendations for white-box coverage levels vary for each SIL, with some being highly recommended (often considered mandatory) and others just recommended (optional with a rationale). SIL 3 typically requires 100% branch coverage and automatically achieves 100% statement coverage.

  | IEC 61508 SIL | 100% Statement Coverage | 100% Branch Coverage |     100% MC/DC     |
  | :-----------: | :---------------------: | :------------------: | :----------------: |
  |       1       |       Recommended       |     Recommended      |    Recommended     |
  |       2       |   Highly recommended    |     Recommended      |    Recommended     |
  |       3       |   Highly recommended    |  Highly recommended  |    Recommended     |
  |       4       |   Highly recommended    |  Highly recommended  | Highly recommended |

- Note that the above SILs and requirements on coverage levels from IEC 61508 are different in ISO
  26262, and different again in DO-178C.
